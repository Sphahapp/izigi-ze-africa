We believe in a living wage for all team members. Based on your education, experience and value you can bring to this role, please share your preferred wage (Please include currency)

Based on my self-taught background, the technical skills I bring, and the value I can deliver to this role, my preferred wage is **$65,000 - $75,000 USD per year**.

HERE'S MY REASONING:

**Technical Skills & Value:**
While I don't have formal industry experience, I bring:
- **Proven ability to build complete automation systems** from scratch
- **Strong technical foundation**: React, TypeScript, API integration, workflow automation
- **Systems thinking**: I understand how to design and implement end-to-end solutions
- **Immediate contribution potential**: I can start adding value from day one

**Market Positioning:**
- Entry-level automation/integration specialists typically earn $45,000 - $60,000
- Mid-level specialists earn $60,000 - $85,000
- My skills align more with mid-level capabilities, but I recognize I'm entry-level in industry experience

**Why This Range:**
- **$65,000** reflects my technical skills and proven ability to deliver results independently
- **$75,000** represents the value I can bring once I learn your specific tools and processes
- This range shows I value my contributions while being realistic about my industry experience level
- It positions me for growth as I gain experience and prove my value

**What I Bring at This Level:**
- Ability to work independently with minimal supervision
- Quick learning curve—I'll master your tools (Zapier, GoHighLevel, etc.) rapidly
- Fresh perspective and innovative problem-solving
- Self-motivation and discipline proven through 1,200+ hours of independent work
- Immediate productivity—I won't need extensive training to start contributing

**Growth Mindset:**
I'm open to discussing this range based on:
- The specific responsibilities and scope of the role
- Benefits package and growth opportunities
- Performance-based increases as I prove my value
- Your company's compensation structure

**My Commitment:**
At this compensation level, I commit to:
- Learning your tools and processes quickly (productive within weeks)
- Contributing immediately and finding ways to add value
- Exceeding expectations and growing into the role
- Being a long-term team member who becomes more valuable over time

I believe this range fairly compensates my technical skills while acknowledging I'm new to the industry. I'm confident I'll prove to be worth this investment and more as I gain experience and contribute to your team's success.

I'm open to discussing this further and finding a compensation package that works for both of us.
