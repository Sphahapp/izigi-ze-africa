What are your personal goals for the next 1-2 years?

My personal goals for the next 1-2 years are focused on professional growth, skill development, and making meaningful contributions to a team. Here's my roadmap:

YEAR 1 GOALS:

**Professional Development:**
- **Land a role where I can contribute immediately** while learning from experienced developers
- **Master industry best practices**: Learn how professional teams structure code, conduct code reviews, handle version control, and collaborate effectively
- **Deepen my expertise in automation and integration**: Become proficient in tools like Zapier, GoHighLevel, or similar platforms used in the industry
- **Build production-grade systems**: Transition from building solo projects to contributing to systems that serve real users at scale

**Technical Skills:**
- **Expand backend knowledge**: While I'm strong in frontend (React, TypeScript), I want to deepen my understanding of backend architecture, databases, and server-side development
- **Learn DevOps fundamentals**: Understand deployment pipelines, CI/CD, monitoring, and infrastructure management
- **Master API design**: Learn to design robust, scalable APIs that other developers can easily integrate
- **Improve testing practices**: Develop expertise in unit testing, integration testing, and test-driven development

**Industry Knowledge:**
- **Understand the business side**: Learn how technical decisions impact business outcomes, user experience, and company goals
- **Master the tools of the trade**: Become proficient in whatever automation, CRM, or workflow tools the company uses
- **Learn industry-specific workflows**: Understand how different industries (marketing, healthcare, SaaS) use technology to solve problems

YEAR 2 GOALS:

**Leadership & Impact:**
- **Take ownership of features or systems**: Progress from implementing features to owning entire modules or systems
- **Mentor others**: Share knowledge with junior developers or team members, just as I've learned from the community
- **Contribute to architecture decisions**: Use my experience building systems from scratch to contribute to technical planning
- **Improve processes**: Identify inefficiencies in workflows and propose solutions based on my automation experience

**Advanced Skills:**
- **System architecture**: Design scalable systems that can handle growth and changing requirements
- **Performance optimization**: Master techniques for optimizing applications at scale
- **Security best practices**: Deepen understanding of secure coding, data protection, and compliance
- **Advanced automation**: Build complex workflow automations that integrate multiple systems seamlessly

**Career Growth:**
- **Become a go-to person** for automation and integration challenges
- **Build a reputation** for delivering reliable, well-documented solutions
- **Expand my impact**: Contribute to projects that make a measurable difference to the business and users

PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT:

**Continuous Learning:**
- **Stay current with technology**: Continue learning new frameworks, tools, and best practices as they emerge
- **Build side projects**: Continue building projects that solve real problems, applying what I learn at work
- **Contribute to open source**: Give back to the community that helped me learn

**Work-Life Integration:**
- **Maintain work-life balance**: Apply the time management skills I've developed to maintain productivity while avoiding burnout
- **Keep the passion alive**: Continue to be excited about technology and automation, using that energy to drive innovation

**Network & Community:**
- **Build professional relationships**: Connect with other developers, learn from their experiences, and share my own
- **Attend conferences or meetups**: Engage with the broader tech community
- **Share knowledge**: Write about what I learn, contribute to discussions, and help others on their journey

HOW THESE GOALS ALIGN WITH MY STRENGTHS:

My self-taught journey has given me:
- **Strong foundation**: I've proven I can learn complex technologies independently
- **System thinking**: I understand how to build complete solutions from scratch
- **Problem-solving**: I'm comfortable tackling challenges without step-by-step guidance

My goals build on these strengths by:
- Adding professional collaboration and team experience
- Deepening technical expertise in areas I've only touched on
- Learning industry standards and best practices
- Contributing to larger systems and teams

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:

In 1-2 years, I want to be:
- A valued team member who can independently tackle complex automation and integration challenges
- Someone who not only writes code but understands how it fits into business goals
- A developer who continues to learn and grow while making meaningful contributions
- Someone who can mentor others and share knowledge effectively

I'm excited about the opportunity to grow in a professional environment, learn from experienced developers, and apply my self-taught skills to real-world challenges. I see this role as the perfect next step in achieving these goals, and I'm committed to contributing from day one while continuously learning and improving.
