## How to Use the Enhanced Narrator Scripts with Hume AI

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Step 1: Choose Your Script

You have two options:

1. **`presentation_narrator_script.md`** - Complete comprehensive script (25-30 minutes)
   - Full detailed presentation
   - All features covered in depth
   - Best for standalone presentations

2. **`presentation_slide_by_slide_script.md`** - Slide-synchronized script (12-17 minutes)
   - Matches your presentation slides
   - Shorter, more focused
   - Best for slide-show presentations

### Step 2: Copy to Hume AI

1. Open your chosen script file
2. Copy the entire content
3. Paste into Hume AI's text input
4. The scripts are already formatted with Hume AI markers

## 📝 Script Markers Explained

All scripts use these markers that Hume AI will interpret naturally:

### Pauses
- `[PAUSE]` = Short pause (0.5-1 second)
- `[PAUSE - LONG]` = Longer pause (2-3 seconds)

**Usage Example:**
```
Welcome to IZIGI ze AFRICA [PAUSE] an AI Development Studio [PAUSE - LONG]
```

### Breathing
- `[BREATHE]` = Natural breathing moment

**Usage:**
```
[BREATHE]
This gives the voice time to breathe naturally...
```

### Gestures (Optional for Video)
- `[GESTURE: description]` = Physical gesture cue

**Note:** If you're creating video with gestures, these markers show when to gesture. If audio-only, Hume AI will naturally emphasize these moments.

### Emphasis
- `[EMPHASIS]` = Words to stress with voice

**Example:**
```
This is [EMPHASIS] truly revolutionary.
```

### Tone Changes
- `[TONE: description]` = Voice tone instruction

**Common tones used:**
- `[TONE: Welcoming, enthusiastic]`
- `[TONE: Serious, problem-focused]`
- `[TONE: Confident, solution-focused]`
- `[TONE: Technical, confident]`
- `[TONE: Business-focused, value-driven]`

## 🎤 Hume AI Voice Settings Recommendations

### Recommended Voice Settings:

1. **Voice Type**: 
   - Choose a professional, clear voice
   - Male or female - your preference
   - Should sound authoritative but friendly

2. **Speed/Pace**:
   - **Moderate**: 150-180 words per minute
   - Not too fast (hard to follow)
   - Not too slow (loses engagement)

3. **Emphasis Handling**:
   - Hume AI will naturally emphasize `[EMPHASIS]` markers
   - No additional settings needed

4. **Pause Handling**:
   - Hume AI will respect `[PAUSE]` markers
   - Adjust timing if needed in post-processing

5. **Tone Variations**:
   - Hume AI will adapt tone based on `[TONE:]` markers
   - Test different voices to find best match

## 🔧 Post-Processing Tips

### Audio Editing After Hume AI:

1. **Normalize Volume**:
   - Ensure consistent volume throughout
   - No sudden volume jumps

2. **Remove Long Silence**:
   - Some `[PAUSE - LONG]` might be too long
   - Trim if needed for your pacing

3. **Add Subtle Background Music** (Optional):
   - Low volume (10-15% max)
   - Instrumental only
   - Should not distract from narration

4. **Quality Check**:
   - Listen through completely
   - Check pronunciation of technical terms
   - Verify emphasis is correct

## 🎬 Using with Slides

### If Using Slide Presentation:

1. **Use `presentation_slide_by_slide_script.md`**
2. Look for `[NEXT SLIDE]` markers
3. Manually advance slides at these points
4. Or edit script to remove these markers if auto-syncing

### Slide Synchronization:

The script includes:
- `[NEXT SLIDE]` = Signal to advance slide
- Timing matched to slide content
- Natural pauses for slide viewing

**Example:**
```
[PAUSE - LONG] [NEXT SLIDE]
## SLIDE 2: The Problem
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Natural Sounding Narration:

1. **Keep Pauses Natural**:
   - Don't add too many pauses
   - Script already has optimal spacing

2. **Emphasis Sparingly**:
   - Only emphasize truly important points
   - Script already marks key emphasis

3. **Tone Changes**:
   - Script includes tone markers
   - Hume AI should follow these naturally

4. **Breathing Points**:
   - Script marks natural breathing spots
   - Don't remove these - they sound natural

### For Professional Quality:

1. **Test a Short Section First**:
   - Generate 1-2 minutes first
   - Verify voice and pacing work
   - Adjust before full generation

2. **Listen Through Once**:
   - Check entire presentation
   - Note any issues
   - Make corrections and regenerate if needed

3. **Match to Visuals** (if using slides):
   - Sync audio to slide timing
   - Adjust pauses if slides need more viewing time
